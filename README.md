# transmission-qt-AppImage

AppImage made using [sharun](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/sharun), which makes it extremely easy to turn any binary into a portable package without using containers or similar tricks.

**This AppImage bundles everything and should work on any linux distro, even on musl based ones.**

It is possible that this appimage may fail to work with appimagelauncher, I recommend these alternatives instead: 

* [AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM) `am -i transmission-qt` or `appman -i transmission-qt`

* [dbin](https://github.com/xplshn/dbin) `dbin install transmission-qt.appimage`

* [soar](https://github.com/pkgforge/soar) `soar install transmission-qt`

This appimage works without fuse2 as it can use fuse3 instead, it can also work without fuse at all thanks to the [uruntime](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/uruntime)
